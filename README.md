# Onepage website for Kharkiv urban fest
I was inspired by the web design of my friend [Valeria Gershannik](https://www.behance.net/gallery/188223681/Kharkiv-Urban-Festival-Landing-Page) and want to make this project live. 

This is a landing page with a call to action button to register users for the Kharkiv City Festival. 

## Stack
* React
* CSS

Experimentally, I create each screen as an independent component with its own style file. 

## Things to do
* Embed database to collect emails from registration form

## How it looks
