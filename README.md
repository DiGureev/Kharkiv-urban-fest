# Onepage website for Kharkiv urban fest
I was inspired by the webdesign of my friend [Valeria Gershannik](https://www.behance.net/gallery/188223681/Kharkiv-Urban-Festival-Landing-Page), and want to make this project live. 

This is a landing page with call to action button to registrate users for the Kharkiv urban festival. 

## Stack
React
CSS

Experimentally I create all screens as a independent component with its own style file. 

## Things to do
* Embed Database to collect emails from Registration form

## How it looks
